# skyrimCursor
Corrects the game cursor when using fullscreen


When you play skyrim on fullscreen and minimize the game, sometimes after you return to the game the mouse bugs and you can see both the game mouse and the windows mouse, being really annoying to play.

I made this program to hide the windows mouse when you return to skyrim and show again when minimizing.

Don't need to open it before skyrim, you can do it anytime you want.
